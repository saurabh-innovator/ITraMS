Intelligent Trasport Management System
The idea is to design a system that will provide a fleet of vehicles connected in real time. This will ensure a smart driving experience, greater safety of both the driver and the vehicle, increased comfort and only authorized vehicle accessibility. We aim to achieve the aforesaid by installing a smart authentication system and through online vehicle monitoring, controlling and surveillance using a mobile application. Also, the commercial and practical utility of the vehicle would be enhanced by using features like image-processing and geo-fencing.
Features:
1. Information about the real-time location of vehicle (Co-ordinates as well as geo-coded address of the area.)
2. Recognition of the street signs
3. Stop the engine of the vehicle from a remote location in case of theft.
4. Information regarding nearby utilities (Like Hospitals, Police station, Restaurants, Malls, etc.)
5. Instant notification to the owner in case of over-speeding.
6. Restricting the mobility of the vehicle by geo-fencing feature.
7. See your travel history on the map
